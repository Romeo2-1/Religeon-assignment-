  <!-- Islam is a major world religion that was founded in the 7th century by the prophet Muhammad in the Arabian Peninsula. 
      Islam is based on the belief in one God (Allah) and the acceptance of the teachings of the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam.
      Muslims believe that the Quran contains the word of God as revealed to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. Islam is characterized by the Five Pillars, 
      which include the declaration of faith (Shahada), prayer (Salat), charity (Zakat), fasting during Ramadan (Sawm), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). 
      The teachings of Islam emphasize the importance of social justice, equality, and compassion towards others, and Muslims are expected to follow ethical 
      and moral principles in their daily lives. Islam has had a significant impact on world history, culture, and civilization, and its followers constitute
      a diverse and global community of more than 1.8 billion people. -->
